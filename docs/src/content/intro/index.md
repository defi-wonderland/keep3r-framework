xKeeper is a keeper network aggregator which aims to decentralise the on-chain automation of DeFi. With xKeeper, using multiple keeper networks, such as Keep3r Network, Gelato, or others, will be a walk in the park.

xKeeper is a fully modular framework, designed to be the backbone of future onchain automation.
