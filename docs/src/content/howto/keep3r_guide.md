## Tutorial: Automate with Keep3r Relay

This guide provides a step-by-step process to create and manage automated tasks using the Keep3r Network.

### Step 1: Deployment of the Automation Vault

**Automation Vault**

    - If you already have an automation vault, you can skip this step, if not, deploy and configure the automation vault. You can follow the guide in step by step (./step_by_step.md). Using this relay you need to configure the relay for any caller.

### Step 2: Register Job in Keep3r Network

**Register Job**

- To get started you will need to register your job on Keep3r Network. To do this you can use its UI which facilitates this task: https://keep3r.network/. In addition, you will have to implement the necessary functions for compatibility with Keep3r.

- Once the job is registered, you will have to add the liquidity to automate the payments. Remember, using Keep3r it is not necessary to add liquidity to the `automationVault`.

### Step 3: Tracking and Monitoring

**Tracking and Monitoring:**

- Once the task is created, you will have information about the executions and logs in [xkeeper.network](https://xkeeper.network/).
